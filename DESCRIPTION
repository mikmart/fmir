Description: This package provides R functions for easily accessing up to date,
    open weather data, made available by the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
    Use simple R syntax to create HTML queries for the FMI API; download XML
    data from the API and parse it into a regular R data set.
    In order to use the open data API, you'll need to register with the Finnish
    Meteorological Institute. See https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data for
    details.
